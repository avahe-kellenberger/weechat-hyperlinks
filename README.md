# weechat-hyperlinks

## Purpose
This script is being written to display hyperlinks in WeeChat when lengthy URLs are wrapped in the terminal (see [here](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) for details on hyperlinks in terminal emulators).

The current solution for clicking wrapped links in WeeChat is to enter [bare display mode](https://weechat.org/blog/post/2014/02/16/Bare-display), click the link, and then return to WeeChat's normal display. I've found this cumbersome and would like to take a more elegant approach.
